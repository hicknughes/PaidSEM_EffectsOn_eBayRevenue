# PaidSEM_EffectsOn_eBayRevenue
An analysis of paid SEM marketing on eBay revenues across 210 'designated market areas' using 1)Difference in difference, 2)Synthetic Controls and 3)Synthetic Difference in Difference analyses

This dataset includes 210 ‘designated market areas’ (DMAs) in the United States. In 2012, a team
of researchers (Blake et. al. 2014) convinced eBay to stop bidding on any AdWords (the
marketplace through which Google SEM is sold) for 65 of the 210 DMAs where eBay was
previously advertising. These DMAs are viewed as roughly independent markets around
metropolitan centers ranging from Boston to Los Angeles. The pre-treatment period corresponds
to the period April 1, 2012 to May 21, 2012, and the treatment period was the eight weeks
following (and including) May 22, 2012. To be sure, here, treatment means: SEM is off. For the
control DMAs, SEM is on throughout the pre and post treatment period.

I structure the data for analysis in alignment with Arkhangelsky et. al. (2021) and construct point estimates and 95% confidence intervals of the impact on revenue that paid SEM marketing has in percentage points.
